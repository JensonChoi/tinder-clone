# Tinder clone built using React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

The frontend is built using React.js, integrating React components such as [React Tinder Card](https://github.com/3DJakob/react-tinder-card) to make this clone more realistic

The backend uses Node.js runtime and utilizes Express.js to route user requests with specific API endpoints

The user data is stored persistently using MongoDB and MongoClient is used to communicate with the database from the backend

React cookies and user authentication are incorporated into the application to enable users to log in effortlessly

# Usage
### Start frontend
1. Go into the `client` directory
2. Run `npm i` to install npm packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the client

### Start backend
1. Go into the `server` directory
2. Run `npm i` to install npm packages
3. Create a `.env` file that stores the URI from your MongoDB database
4. Run `npm start:backend` to start the server
